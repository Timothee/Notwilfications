    <h3>Hi there!</h3>
    <p>Thanks for installing and trying this extension. As you might have noticed, because it was a proof-of-concept for a Twilio contest, it's actually pretty useless now.</p>
    <p>I finally got around to do something about it, and just warn you that you might want to uninstall the extension :)</p>
    <p>I also got around to put the code on <a href="http://github.com/Timothee/Notwilfications">GitHub</a>. I figured that might be of some interest.</p>
    <p>That's pretty much it. I just wanted to unclutter your Chrome bar with a useless icon.</p>
    <p>I'd be happy to hear about you, so drop me a line: <a href="mailto:timothee@gmail.com">timothee@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Finally, to uninstall the extension, go <a href="chrome://extensions/">here</a> and search for the extension called "Notwilfications".</p>
    <p>Cheers, Tim</p>
    <p>PS: you can find me online at <a href="http://timotheeboucher.com">timotheeboucher.com</a>, but I'm mostly on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/_timothee">@_timothee</a>.</p>
