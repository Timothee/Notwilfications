Hi there,

this is the code for a proof-of-concept I wrote for a Twilio developer contest. (http://contests.twilio.com/)

So, yeah, the key word is PoC. It works in specific conditions and many things are hardcoded :)

But! It did win the contest that week, so it can't be that bad: http://blog.twilio.com/2010/05/announcing-the-winners-of-the-twilio-google-chrome-extensions-contest.html

Cheers,

Tim
